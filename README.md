Engine Balancing Tool


This is a personal development made for KSP/kOS in order to provide an engine balancing to a craft during maneuvers.
It is applicable to VTOL crafts but not only, it can also be used in "forward" mode.

The aim of the tool is to determine the thrust vector then modify the %thrustlimit of engines involved in the global thrust
to align it with the Center of Mass to reduce leverage.

This development was made starting from nothing 3 weeks ago, I had to learn kOS and do my maths to write the algorithm.
I never looked to another code like MechJeb2 or anything else so if you think the methodology is terrible, it's all my fault ;)
Feel free to comment.
